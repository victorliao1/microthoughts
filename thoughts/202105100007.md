## Hello World!

I've been meaning to start a "blog" for some time now but never really got around to it. However, with extraordinarily good timing my friend Mark Zhang made this lightweight blogging platform which you (the reader) are currently on. Welcome!

As of this moment, I intend to use this as a place to write about technical details for ideas that I'm currently exploring or generally interested in. I suppose this makes me accountable for remembering details about papers and sharpens my writing skills which have dulled ever since I entered university.

I anticipate that only the most curious of readers may end up reading this "blog" but to those of you who do: I hope you have a good time and learn something from what I may write here. If I make any mistakes or if you have any questions feel free to contact me at my email address (I'm sure it won't be too hard to find).
